                    Welcome to the inaugural issue of <strong>TRASH WORLD NEWS</strong>. You might be wondering why
                    we're launching a
                    new
                    'zine at a time when everything is goind digital. The answer is simple: We need a place to share
                    vital and sensitive information about computer systems and networks— a place that doesn't depend
                    on computers itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Have you noticed it lately? Everywhere you go, whatever you do, there's a bank of computers at work
                    behind the scenes making decisions about you. Society at large seems to accept it as a norm that
                    computer programs designed by the powers that be will determine out value to them and treat us
                    accordingly
                </p>
                <div class="floater">
                    <p>
                        We need a place to share vital and sensitive information about computer systems and networks...
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Computers by themselves are just tools that do what they're programmed to do. That's why it's up to
                    us to take up the fight. We need to equip outselves with tools and knowledge so we can push back
                    against this rising tide— so that every time some big system treats ul like we're just a bunch of
                    punch cards for them to process, we can write programs to throw wrenches in the gears of thos grand
                    designs, to force them to acknowledge us as the people we are.

                <p>
                    This issue is all about the small but mighty EXA, the technology that took over the world without
                    anyone noticing. These little things are behind almost everything now, from handheld game consoles
                    to huge corporate servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We'll take you through the ins and outs of those, and hopefully you'll be up and running fast, even
                    if you've never programmed a computer before.
                </p>
                <div class="separator"></div>
                <p>
                    We also have a ton of potentially useful field reports from hackers around the world on topics like
                    data storage formats, noteworthy computer networks, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, there's a real interesting look at the disease known as "the phage" from a research
                    biologist who studied it on her own time and kindly shared her notes with us. I guarantee you won't
                    get this information anywhere else.
